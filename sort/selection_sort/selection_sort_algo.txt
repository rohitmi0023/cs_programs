Thinking...
* Selection sort is all about SELECTING the index of min. element and putting the
  element at the correct position one by one.
1st iteration
* Assume the 1st element index to be the min. index.
* Compare with the rest n-1 terms with the min_index and find the 
  min. index among all of them.
* Place the min. index value at the 1st position
2nd iteration
* Assume the 2nd element index to be the min. index.
* Compare with the rest n-2 terms and find the min. index.
* Place the min. index value at the 2nd position.

Algorithm...
Selection_Sort(a)
n = a.length
for i = 0 to n-1:
    min_index = i
    for j = i+1 to n-1:
        if a[min_index] > a[j]:
            min_index = j
    swap a[min_index] with a[i]
